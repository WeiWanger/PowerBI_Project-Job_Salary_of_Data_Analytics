# Data Analysis of Job Salary 

### Project Overview
 This project delves into the dynamics of salaries within data analytics-related jobs over the last four years. It examines various factors such as job titles, categories, experience levels, working settings, company sizes, and locations to uncover trends and patterns. The aim is to use these insights for data-driven decision-making, enhancing understanding of how salaries have evolved across different dimensions during this period. This comprehensive analysis serves as a guide to the changing landscape of data analytics salaries.
